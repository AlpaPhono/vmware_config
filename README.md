# INTRODUCTION
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this file is to document the process of trying to configure ansible or terraform to provision resources from VMware.<br.>
**The Task**<br/>
Write a script that creates a vm with the following specs:<br/>
- 16GB RAM
- 100GB disk space
- Linux OS
A virtual Network that consists of:<br/>
- 2 subnets 

Having no prior experience with the vmware platform The first step of approach was to do some research on it.

## VMware

- Provides cloud computing and platform virtualisation software and services.
- Has **type1** hypervisors that run directly on server hardware without requiring an additional underlaying operating system.<br/>

### What is virtualisation
To create a virtual version of a device or resource. i.e (server, storage device, network, OS)<br/>

- devices, applications and human users are able to interact with virtual resource as if it were a real single resource
- disk partition is an example of virtualisation

### What is a hypervisor 
<br/>
> A virtual machine monitor(VMM). computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
<br/>

### Types of Hyperviser
<br/>

**Type 1:**<br/>
Bare metal Hypervisor<br/>

- runs directly on the hardware (firmware)

**Type 2:**<br/>
Host OS Hypervisor<br/>

- An operating system that has a hypervisor (software)
<br/>
## What is VMware: vSphere ESXi and vCenter
<br/>

### vSphere ESXi

- ESXi is type 1 Hypervisor firmware
	- Allows for basic creation and management of virtual machines and networking
	- 
- vSphere management interface provides access on a per server basis and is accessed by browsing to the IP of ESXi host
- vSphere is also an enterprise cloud management platform provided by vmware that is a paid for service

### vCenter

> Central management interface to manage all ESXi hosts and VMs<br/>
- use it configure the ESCXi Hosts

# CONFIGURATION WITH ANSIBLE 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
Infrastructure drift: Cases where the infrastructure state changes and doesnt match the one defined in code
<br/>
Ansible can be used as an IAC tool, however it isnt the most preferred. This is due to the fact ansible doesn't keep a log of the state of the infrastructure to ensure preservation. <br/>
Due to the small scale of this task, Infrastructure drift is not a big concern.

## Ansible and VMware

There is a well supported community collection that can be used as ansible modules to manange vmware softwares.

> To confifure Ansible for VMware:<br/>
- Install pyVmomi
- Install community.vmware
(Ansible Docs)
- create inventory & playbook

(Ansible Piolt,2022)

To use ansible to configure VMware I need to configure ansible to be able to use VMware modules.<br/>
Using:<br/>
ansible-galaxy install collection community.vmware<br/>

- I download the VMware collection and added it into my working directory under the collections folder.
- added an ansible.cfg file within working directory so that ansible would search for the newly added collection within the working directory
(madapparambath, 39:05)

- wrote the script that should aid in creating a vm off of the vmware firmware. I dont have log-in credentials and I dont have the ip address of the machine to test it out.




#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONFIGURATION WITH TERRAFORM
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform was my initial choice to use to perform this task.<br/>
I quickly hit a roadblock when I realised that I wasn't sure which providers to configure terraform with as I wasn't aware of to which tools where being used to manage the vm datacenter.<br/>
<br/>

## Terraform and VMware
<br/>
There is provider support for the vsphere, NSX-T and all the other vmware cloud services.


# Conclusion

- I was able to write a script on ansible that is designed to automate the process of creating a vm of the requested specs.
- Ansible proved easier for the inital configuration but at an enterprise level I would prefer to use Terraform.
- I was able to write a script that would create a vswitch that creates a virtual network.
- I was unable to write a script to configure the virtual network to the requested specification
<br/><br/>

- The script is unlikely to work as I was unable to test it without access to the vCenter/vSphere/esxi console. 
- More reserach is required to properly configure networks and subnets using the vswitches.
<br/>
This was a great learning experience that deepened my knowledge on hypervisors and virtualisation.<br/>
It broadend my knowledge on physical datacenters and the capabilities of ansible.<br/>
Prior to this I had only used ansible as a configuration management tool however I can see that its application can be used at several stages within the CICD pipeline.
